# Blockchain Exploration with Truffle and Ethereum

### Summary

Created in the beginning of 2019, these assets represent some exploration of the Blockchain basics using Ethereum via Truffle, Ganache, and web3.js as the primary interface.  This prototype is focused on some basic smart contract interactions and approaches for robust testing.

The code is prototype-level, which is to say that it is rudimentary without adherence to best practices and with polish far short of something that I’d consider to be production-worthy.  The functionality is basic, intended to explore concepts rather than provide any useful tasks.  Because this was an upskilling effort, I did try to comment extensively to narrate what was going on and why.

There remains a ton of depth which I haven’t explored, both in term of the mechanics of using a Blockchain and the architectural considerations.  Some unexplored topics of interest are deciding the appropriate role is for smart contracts in a real-world system, how to model domains, when to use on-chain versus off-chain storage, and how to best incorporate custom consensus mechanisms for block approval.

#### Warning

This project was a point-in-time experiment and is not actively maintained.  Assets have aged and may have security vulnerabilities.  It is highly recommended that dependencies aare updated before making use of any project assets.
