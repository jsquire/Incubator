### Overview ###

This repository is a sandbox for artifacts under exploration and experimentation; it is recommended that assets be looked at as  ideation and prototypes and not in any way production quality.  As such, the documents and code herein are of differing quality and levels of polish.  Code may not follow the expected standards, conventions, or best practices; test coverage may be spotty or missing.  Each document and project should be considered a self-contained asset and may follow a completely different convention from others; there should be no expectation of cohesion in approach, technology, and conventions used.  

Should any project graduate to something that will be more formally pursued, it will migrate to another repository.  This repository is best viewed volatile, with artifacts that will continue to evolve over time.

### Structure ###

* **root**
  <br />_The root contains the overall repository configuration files, license, and general structure._

* **src**
  <br />_The base container for code artifacts, be they a protoype project or just a loose collection of files.  These are further organized by subfolder to differentiate projects and languages/platforms.  The intent is that contents of each subfolder under `src` each are independent, with each having a dedicated ReadMe to offer context-sensitive information about the project._   

### Licensing ###
The artifacts in this repository are offered under the MIT license, as described in the accompanying [license](./LICENSE "license") file.  Feel free to use the code in your own projects or the documents as templates as you see fit.  Should these works prove helpful or inspire you to iterate on them in creative ways, I find that to be a huge compliment.  We all build upon the work of those who have come before us.  In general, formal attribution is not necessary, though it is always appreciated.  I do ask, however, that you not copy an item verbatim and pass it off as your own work.
